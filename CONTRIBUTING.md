2. **Implementation Requirements** 
   - Keep code lightweight and efficient
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies (e.g., TQDM for progress bars, where it could be easily replaced with a function)
   - Benchmark performance-critical code to ensure it is optimized
   - Use NumPy arrays for multidimensional data
   - Use Numba for JIT-compiled functions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document all public functions and classes
   - Include usage examples where appropriate
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
   - Add references for complex algorithms

4. **Pull Request Process**
