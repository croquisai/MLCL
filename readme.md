# MLCL

MLCL is a OpenCL-focused machine learning library with the following design goals:
- Small install size
- Easy to use
- Fast
- Flexible
- OpenCL-based for GPU acceleration
- JIT for CPUs (if OpenCL isn't supported!)

## Installation

For now, you will need to pull the repository and run `pip install .` from the root directory.

```bash
